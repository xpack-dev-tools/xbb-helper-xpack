This project currently serves as a secondary tool for building
the primary xPack Development Tools. Since these tools are only
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts,
there are no Windows binaries. However, the project can be
used in any builds, and Windows binaries can be added if justified.
