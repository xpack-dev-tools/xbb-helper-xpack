## Overview

{% assign platforms_array = platforms | split: "," -%}

{% if customFields.isOrganizationWeb == "true" -%}

**xPack {{appName}}** is a collection of standalone
cross-platform binary tools,
aimed at reproducible builds.

The intended use case for the main tools was building and testing **C/C++
projects**, with an emphasis on **embedded projects**.

The supplementary tools were needed to build the main tools.
Since these tools are exclusively
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts, for now
there are no Windows binaries. However, the projects are versatile and can be
used in any builds; if necessary, Windows binaries can be added in future
releases.

{% assign names_array = "" | split: "" -%}

{% for platform in platforms_array -%}
{% if platform == "win32-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "Windows" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-x64" or platform == "darwin-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-x64" or platform == "linux-arm64" or platform == "linux-arm" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

{% assign names_array = names_array | uniq -%}

**xPack {{appName}}** is a standalone
{% if names_array.size > 1 %}cross-platform ({{ names_array | join: ", " }}){% else %}{{ names_arra | first }}{% endif %} binary
distribution of {{appName}},
aimed at reproducible builds.

<Overview/>

The open source **xPack {{appName}}** project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/{{gitHubProjectName}}`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/{{gitHubProjectName}});
it provides the platform specific binaries as
[release assets](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/{{gitHubProjectName}}/releases).

In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
[build scripts](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/{{gitHubProjectName}}/tree/xpack/build-assets/scripts).

<UpgradeNotice/>

{%- endif %}

## Features

All binaries are:

- **self-contained** (include all required libraries)
- **file-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location)
- built on slightly older systems (to make them run on both old and new systems)

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack {{appName}}** are:

{% assign names_array = "" | split: "" -%}

{% for platform in platforms_array -%}
{% if platform == "win32-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 Windows" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm64 macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm64 GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-arm" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
{% if names_array.size > 1 %}procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**{{ names_array | join: "**, **" }}**){% else %}procedure on **{{ names_array | join: "" }}**{% endif %}
- multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system
- no need to worry about dependent libraries, all are included
- significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric
- projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.

## Install

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.
